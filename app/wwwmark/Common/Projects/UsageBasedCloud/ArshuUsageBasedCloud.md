# Usage based Cloud 

The cloud workloads may be moving towards actual usage based charging from the current subscription based charging.

Current Major Cloud providers services are majorly subscription based irrespective of Usage and newer cloud providers are providing usage based pricing of compute/memory at the edge

## What

Build Management Solutions for applications and clonable applications to leverage the Usage Based Cloud and Overcome the limitations of the Scale to Zero.

## Why

As the cloud becomes expensive at higher usage, there may be treads to optimize cloud costs and reduce vendor lock-in.

There is also a trend in cloud technology which may favor usage based cloud

* Previous cloud was based on Virtual Machines,
* Current cloud is based on Containers
* Future cloud may be based on 
* * Micro Virtual Machines ([fly](https://fly.io)</a>)
* * Uni Kernel Machines ([unikraft](https://unikraft.cloud/)</a>)
* * WASI Hosting [fermyon](https://www.fermyon.com/")

As the cloud moves to running LLM workloads, it becomes imperative that LLM workloads are offered on usage based pricing rather than subscription based to get competitive advantage for both the provider / subscriber.

#### Compare Cost of CPU Vs Cost of GPU (based on fly.io charging)

* *  Minimum Cost of CPU Compute - shared-cpu-1x	1 shared CPU =  **$1.94/- Per Month**
* *  Minimum Cost of GPU Compute - A10: $1.50/hr per GPU = 740 * 1.5 = **$1,110/- Per Month**
	
Usage based pricing has technical challenges which the cloud providers cannot solve generically since they are application specific

## How

Publish Articles with solutions on the advantages and limitations on the usage based cloud 

Publish POC Cloud Management Products to overcome the limitations of the usage based cloud

Publish POC Sample Apps on Usage Base Cloud demonstrating the limitations and advantages using Scale to Zero Infrastructure

Provide Subscription based freelancing service for enhancing the POC Cloud Management Products.
