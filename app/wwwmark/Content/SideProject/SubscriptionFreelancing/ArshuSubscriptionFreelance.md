## Why

I live in singapore which is a high cost of living location and hence my charges for freelancing will be expensive when compared to someone from a lower cost of living.

Hence a different strategy is required to pursue freelancing when staying in a high cost of location.

Freelancing is charged based on the effort (Hours) spent to do a particular job even though effort spent on a task will be different based on the skill level/exposure of similiar type of jobs

Hence to be effective in freelancing, repeat freelancing of similiar jobs may be a effective way to reduce the effort spent on a particular task so as to reduce the cost charged to customer

Cost is one aspect of freelancing, another aspect is skill required to do a task. To demonstrate skill, it may be easier to do enhancement of existing product which you have developed

## How

Public POC Ideas which we can develop based on existing skillset of the team.

Develop POC Products for publication to demonstrate skill.

Publish enhancements to existing POC Products which can be done for subscription.
