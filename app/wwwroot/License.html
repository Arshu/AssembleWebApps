                                "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                                direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                                otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
                                outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                                "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
                                exercising permissions granted by this License.

                                including but not limited to software source code, documentation
                                source, and configuration files.

                                and conversions to other media types.

                                "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                                Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

                                (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

                                represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                                of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                                separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

                                or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                                the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

                                2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                                copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                                publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                                Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                                3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                                (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                                use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                                where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                                by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                                institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                                or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                                or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                                as of the date such litigation is filed.

                                4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                                Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                                modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                                meet the following conditions:

                                (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                                (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                                stating that You changed the files; and

                                (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                                the Derivative Works; and

                                (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                                as modifying the License.

                                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                                the conditions stated in this License.

                                5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                                any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                                by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                                this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                                6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                                except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                                7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                                agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                                implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                                of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                                appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                                8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                                unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                                negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                                result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                                Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                                other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                                9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                                APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                                To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                                boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                                replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                                the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                                comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                                file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                                same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                                identification within third-party archives.

                                by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                                institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                                or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                                or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                                as of the date such litigation is filed.

                                4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                                Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                                modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                                meet the following conditions:

                                (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                                (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                                stating that You changed the files; and

                                (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                                the Derivative Works; and

                                (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                                as modifying the License.

                                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                                the conditions stated in this License.

                                5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                                any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                                by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                                this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                                6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                                except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                                7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                                agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                                implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                                of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                                appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                                8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                                unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                                negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                                result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                                Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                                other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                                9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                                APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                                To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                                boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                                replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                                the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                                comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                                file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                                same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                                identification within third-party archives.

                                by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                                institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                                or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                                or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                                as of the date such litigation is filed.

                                4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                                Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                                modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                                meet the following conditions:

                                (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                                (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                                stating that You changed the files; and

                                (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                                the Derivative Works; and

                                (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                                as modifying the License.

                                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                                the conditions stated in this License.

                                5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                                any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                                by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                                this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                                6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                                except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                                7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                                agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                                implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                                of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                                appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                                8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                                unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                                negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                                result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                                Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                                other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                                9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
